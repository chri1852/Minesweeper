To compile open MineSweeperCompile.ps1, and update the $folderFiles and $iconPath varibles to point 
toward the current folder that the powershell script is located. Once that is down, save and close
the file, and then right click on MineSweeperCompile.ps1 and select run with powershell. Assuming 
no errors are encountered the application will show in the specified output location.
