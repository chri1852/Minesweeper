#Minesweeper
This is a minesweeper program I wrote using C# and WinForms in order to teach myself both of those things. It works fine, and I cannot find any bugs with it, but it is running on two years old now, so try and forgive any bad code.

To compile:

1. Open MineSweeperCompile.ps1, and update the $folderFiles and $iconPath varibles to point toward the current folder that the powershell script is located. 
2. Next save and close the file, and then right click on MineSweeperCompile.ps1 and select run with powershell. 
3. Assuming no errors are encountered the application will show in the specified output location.
